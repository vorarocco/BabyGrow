# [BabyGrowth](https://babygrowthapp.herokuapp.com/)
Baby Tracker Information App
### Project Description
My app called [BabyGrowth](https://babygrowthapp.herokuapp.com/)

Follow your child's growth from their first weeks of life up until they leave the nest.  
[BabyGrowth](https://babygrowthapp.herokuapp.com/) empowers you with the tools and knowledge to make sure your baby is developing healthily 
and brings you piece of mind, whether your an expert mother or a first time parent.  
BabyGrowth allows users to track their babyâ€™s daily activities including feedings, diaper, sleep and growth. 
When and how often youer baby is eating and sleeping is crucial information for your baby's doctor, but it can be difficult to keep track of 
over all those sleepless nights. You have a lot to remember, let us help. 
Watch your baby crawl, waddle, walk then run toward a bright and healthy future.
